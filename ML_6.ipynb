    "- Data Collection: Gather a representative and diverse dataset that captures the relevant features and patterns of the problem you are trying to solve.\n",

    "- Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data by handling missing values, outliers, and transforming variables to ensure they are in a suitable format for training.\n",

    "- Training: Split the dataset into training and validation sets. Use the training set to fit the model to the data, adjusting its internal parameters or weights based on the provided input features and known output labels.\n",

    "- Evaluation: Assess the performance of the trained model on the validation set using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or mean squared error. This step helps to measure how well the model generalizes to unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fine-tuning: Adjust the hyperparameters of the model, such as learning rate, regularization strength, or network architecture, to optimize its performance and reduce overfitting.\n",

    "- Combining Weak Models: Ensemble methods often combine multiple weak or base models to create a stronger ensemble model. Weak models can be models with limited accuracy on their own, such as decision trees or simple linear models.\n",

    "- Diversity in Models: The strength of ensemble methods lies in the diversity of the individual models. By using different algorithms, feature subsets, or training data, ensemble methods aim to introduce diverse perspectives and capture different aspects of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Aggregation Strategies: Ensemble methods use various strategies to aggregate the predictions of individual models. Common aggregation techniques include voting (majority or weighted), averaging, stacking, and boosting. The choice of aggregation strategy depends on the specific ensemble method used.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Improved Performance: Ensemble methods can significantly improve the predictive performance of machine learning models. By combining the predictions of multiple models, they can reduce errors, increase accuracy, and handle complex patterns in the data more effectively.\n",

    "- Robustness and Stability: Ensemble methods enhance the robustness and stability of predictions by reducing the impact of outliers or noise in individual models. They can smooth out individual model biases and provide more reliable predictions.\n",

    "- Overfitting Reduction: Ensemble methods can mitigate overfitting, a common problem in machine learning. By combining multiple models, ensemble methods can reduce model variance and generalize better to unseen data.\n",

    "\n",

RMSE is the square root of MSE and is in the same units as the target variable. Lower values indicate better performance. These metrics can be computed using the mean_squared_error function in scikit-learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Mean Absolute Error (MAE): MAE measures the average absolute difference between the predicted and actual values. It provides a measure of the average prediction error. Like MSE and RMSE, lower values are desirable. MAE can be computed using the mean_absolute_error function in scikit-learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Residual Analysis: Residual analysis involves examining the residuals (the differences between the predicted and actual values) to assess the model's performance. Residual plots can be used to check for patterns, such as non-linearity, heteroscedasticity, or outliers. If the residuals exhibit a random scatter around zero, it suggests that the model is capturing the relationship adequately.\n",

    "5. Cross-Validation: Cross-validation is used to assess how well the model generalizes to unseen data. Common techniques include k-fold cross-validation, where the dataset is divided into k equally sized folds, and each fold is used as a test set while the remaining folds are used for training. The average performance across all folds provides a more robust estimate of the model's performance.\n",

Underfitting often leads to high bias, and the model may oversimplify the problem, resulting in low accuracy or poor performance.\n",

The model \"memorizes\" the training data too well, but it fails to generalize to new, unseen data. Overfitting often leads to high variance, and the model may perform exceptionally well on the training data but poorly on the test data.\n",

Bootstrapping allows us to make inferences about the population from which the data is drawn and assess the robustness of the model or estimate.\n",

It involves splitting the dataset into multiple subsets or folds, training the model on a portion of the data (training set), and evaluating its performance on the remaining data (validation set or test set). Cross-validation helps estimate how well the model would perform on unseen data and helps in selecting the best model hyperparameters."
