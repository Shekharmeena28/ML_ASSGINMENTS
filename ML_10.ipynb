    "Imagine you are planning a picnic, and you want to know the probability of rain tomorrow. Initially, you don't have any specific information, so you assign a prior probability based on your general knowledge or intuition. Let's say you believe there is a 30% chance of rain tomorrow (this is your prior probability).\n",
